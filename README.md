Sleepless Coding Saga 3.0 We are Team Zelda and we have made an automated Finance Tracker to track all personal finances. SMS is the only reliable place which has all the transactions taken place since we use Multiple UPI apps and bank transfers are not logged in any single UPI app, and many a time the SMS is filled with spam. Our app, FinTrack scrapes your SMS for relevent messages regarding transactions and tabulates and categorises them into different baskets. We deliver detailed weekly and monthly analysis of your spending and saving habits and recommends smart goals to stay financially healthy. We have also added a chatbot to the app to answer any deeper analysis questions you may have.
